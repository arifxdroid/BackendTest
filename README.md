This is a Node.js project built with Express.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, and Redis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run ``npm install`` to install the dependencies.
3. Set up a ``MongoDB`` instance and update the ``MONGODB_URI`` environment variable in the ``.env`` file.
4. Set up a Redis instance and update the ``REDIS_URL environment`` variable in the ``.env`` file.
5. Run ``npm run build`` to compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
6. Run ``npm start`` to start the server.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
```
src/
|-- helpers/
|   |-- exampleHelper.ts
|   |-- ...
|-- interfaces/
|   |-- example.ts
|   |-- ...
|-- models/
|   |-- exampleModel.ts
|   |-- ...
|-- routes/
|   |-- exampleRoute.ts
|   |-- ...
|-- server.ts
```
- The ``helpers`` directory contains the helper functions.
- The ``interfaces`` directory contains the different type of interfaces.
- The ``models`` directory contains the database models.
- The ``routes`` directory contains the route definitions.
- ``server.ts`` is where the Express.js app is configured and the entry point for the application.

## Environment Variables
The following environment variables are used in the application:

- ``PORT`` (optional, default: ``3000``): The port the server should listen on.
- ``MONGODB_URI`` (required): The URI for the MongoDB instance.
- ``REDIS_URL`` (required): The URL for the Redis instance.

 
## Scripts
The following scripts are available in the project:

- ``npm run start``: Starts the server.
- ``npm run build``: Compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
<!-- - ``npm run lint``: Runs the linter.
- ``npm run lint:fix``: Runs the linter and fixes any fixable errors.
- ``npm test``: Runs the tests. -->

<!-- ## Testing
The tests are located in the ``test`` directory. To run the tests, use the ``npm test`` command. The tests use the ``mocha`` test framework and ``chai`` assertion library. The tests are written in TypeScript and use the ``ts-node`` package to compile the TypeScript code on the fly. -->
